                    Heya, my name is Kenny. I am a third year Computer Science major from a small town in Long Island, New York called Southold. 
                    I often spend my free time there taking long walks or fishing at the beach where I would take the oppurtunity to clean up any trash left behind by others. 
                    Additionally whenever I'm back home I try to participate in food drives at my local food shelter
                    as well as help with my parent's family business. While I'm attending college at Georgia Tech I find myself tutoring others who need help with certain courses in my free time.
                    <br><br>I also have two cats (Wanted to include)
